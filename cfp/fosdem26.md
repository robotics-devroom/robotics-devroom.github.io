# Fosdem 26 Call for Participation

We're excited to announce the second Robotics and Simulation devroom at FOSDEM 2026, scheduled for Saturday, January 31!

### Summary
A Robotics and Simulation dev room at FOSDEM, focused on core robotics libraries, frameworks, simulation tools, and open-source platforms. The selected talks will cover key tools like robotics frameworks as well as modern AI trends, showcasing advancements and projects in the field. The event will feature presentations, a lightning talk session and a demo session, offering a platform for developers to share work and foster collaboration. 

### Scope of Talks

Due to the varied and interdisciplinary nature of robotics as a field, numerous topics could fit a ‘Robotics and Simulation’ devroom. To help the speakers target their presentations to a specific audience and to minimize the overlap with other established FOSDEM devrooms, we defined the scope of this devroom by listing key areas of interest:
* Core robotics libraries and applications. Mapping, planning, localization, perception, and control solutions would fit this category. For example, [Cartographer], [OMPL], [grid_map], [Octomap], [PCL], [OpEn], [OpenRMF].
* Frameworks used when building robotics applications. Examples include [ROS], [Dora-RS], [OpenRR], [YARP], [Zenoh],  [Copper-rs], and [Eclipse iceoryx].
* Specific robotic simulation software like [Gazebo], [Coppelia], or simulations using non-robotic tools, like [Bevy], [Godot], [Isaac Sim], [MuJoCo].
* Robotic-specific devops and related tooling, like [webviz], [MCAP].
* Robotics platforms friendly for open source development, like [Arduino], [Crazyflie], [Turtlebot].
* Robotic products implemented using open source software. This can include examples of AI methods used to teach robots to perform specific tasks or control robots using LLMs; for example: [dora-rs], [ros2ai], [robo-gym], [LeRobot].

The examples mentioned are meant to be descriptive and not restricted. Talks could be improvements to any of the mentioned packages, interesting uses of them, alternatives with different degrees of maturity, or totally unrelated to them.
