This website is created and handled by the Robotics and Simulation Developer Room committee.

The Robotics and Simulation devroom is a robotics community organized developer room that has been held at [FOSDEM 2025](https://fosdem.org/2025) and will be held again at [FOSDEM 2026](https://fosdem.org/2026).
A Fosdem devroom is akin to a mini conference: the room and technical needs is made available by FOSDEM organization but all content decision and actual organization of the room is handled by the devroom team.
