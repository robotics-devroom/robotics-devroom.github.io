This website is created and handled by the Robotics and Simulation devroom committee.

The Robotics and Simulation devroom is a Fosdem devroom that has been held at Fosdem 2025 and will be at Fosdem 2026.
A Fosdem devroom is akin of a mini conference: the room and technical needs is made available by Fosdem but all
content decision and actual organization of the room is handled by the devroom team.
